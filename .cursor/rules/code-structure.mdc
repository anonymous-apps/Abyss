When writing source files, use [example-class-file.ts](mdc:.cursor/examples/example-class-file.ts) as a baseline for what proper source file struture is like. Wherever possible, adopt this structure.
For cases where we have a standalone utility and not a class, use [example-utility-file.ts](mdc:.cursor/examples/example-utility-file.ts) for reference
