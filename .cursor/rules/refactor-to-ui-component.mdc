The curren open / provided file from the packages/app/src folder is the target component for this transofmration. I want this component to instead live in the packages/ui-componenets library

Do the following:
- Understand what this component does
- Read the button component from [button.tsx](mdc:packages/app/src/library/input/button.tsx) [Button.stories.tsx](mdc:packages/ui-components/src/components/inputs/Button/Button.stories.tsx) for reference as to what a well structured component could be
- Create a new component folder under the ui-components/src/components/[grouping] where you see fit
- Add a stories.tsx, an index.ts a [component].tsx and updeat the index.ts with the data
- Add a seperate types.ts file for tracking types for components
- Dont add any README.md files for it though


When building the component, make use of tailwind css styles, and follow how other components are structured.
More generally, dont overcomplicate things. If the referenced component didnt have a disabled state, dont add one. If it lacked a loading state, dont add one. Ect.
