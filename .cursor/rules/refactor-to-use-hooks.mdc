The current open page needs to match the style guide for pages in this application, specifically we should have two files

- mypage.page.tsx - renders the page and uses the hook file
- mypage.hook.ts - abstracts away all the state for simplicity

See example files like this:
- [database-table.tsx](mdc:packages/app/src/library/content/database-table.tsx) & [database.page.tsx](mdc:packages/app/src/pages/database/database.page.tsx)

Specifically the I have referenced another page (not the database table page above) which I want you to refactor into the -hook -page design
