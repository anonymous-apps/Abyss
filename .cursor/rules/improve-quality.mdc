This rule means that for the current execution, i want you to consider the files in the workspace, and the specific file i mentioned, and apply the correct style guides to it. Consider the example files from the code structure document. Make sure the target file follows this guide.

Additionally, i want you to go through the source code and make it better. You are a smart AI, use your judegment, and make the code more readable, more well written, and easier to work with for an enginner. I want you to optimize for engineering readability less than execution efficiency.
